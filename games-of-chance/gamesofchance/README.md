## Games of Chance (Python)

### Description

In this project, I will be using Python to create a number of games that you can bet on. The program iterates through the games allowing you to place wagers. You will be asked if you want to play again after each game finishes, if not you will move onto the next game.

### How it works

I have used Python and the Django framework for this project. This program is only playable from the terminal but I am also going to create a version that can be accessed via a browser using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
