## Magic Eight ball (Java)

### Description

The Magic 8-Ball is a super popular toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice, developed in the 1950s!

Write a Magic8.java program that will output a random fortune each time it executes.

### How it works

I have used simple 'if' conditional statements that take a random number value from 1 - 20 and print a random fortune each time it executes.

This program needs a compiler to work, so in its current state it will not run.
